# Banking-Churn-Prediction
Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict customer churn in the banking sector. The project involved comprehensive preprocessing (label encoding, one-hot encoding, feature scaling), model architecture design, and performance optimization through iterative training and evaluation on real-world customer data.
