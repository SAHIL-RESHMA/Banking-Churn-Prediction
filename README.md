# üîÑ Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project implements a deep learning model to predict whether a customer will **exit (churn)** from a bank based on structured customer profile data. The model uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras and applies comprehensive preprocessing to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## üìå Key Features

- Developed a binary classification model using **Keras Sequential API**.
- Performed **label encoding**, **one-hot encoding**, and **feature scaling** for preprocessing.
- Built a **fully connected feedforward neural network (ANN)**.
- Trained and evaluated the model using real-world bank customer data.
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting customer churn behavior.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Extracted input features (X) and target (y).
- Applied **Label Encoding** on `Gender` and **One-Hot Encoding** on `Geography`.
- Used **StandardScaler** for feature normalization.

### 2. Model Building
- Built a **3-layer neural network**:
  - Two hidden layers with ReLU activation.
  - One output layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

### 3. Training
- Compiled the model using:
  - Optimizer: `adam`
  - Loss: `binary_crossentropy`
- Trained over 100 epochs with batch size = 10.

### 4. Evaluation
- Generated predictions and evaluated with:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Accuracy Score**
